    <h3>Litti Chokha Recipe | Litti Recipe</h3>
    <p>
      If thereâ€™s one combination that is the hallmark of Bihari cuisine, it is
      the Litti Chokha. This is basically a very traditional and rustic dish of
      spiced sattu (roasted black chickpea flour) stuffed whole wheat dough
      balls called Litti. This is classically paired with a simple veggie mash
      essentially with onion, garlic, green chilies and mustard oil, called the
      chokha. It is a delicacy in the food culture of both Bihar as well as
      Jharkhand. Here in this post, I have shared the recipe of the Litti in
      particular and also the three chokha variants.

    <h4>What is Litti Chokha</h4>
    <p>
      As I mentioned in the beginning, Litti is a whole wheat flour dough ball
      that is stuffed with an earthy, spiced mixture of sattu or roasted black
      chickpea or kala chana flour. Chokha, on the other hand, is a very basic
      mashed relish made of vegetables like brinjal (aubergine/eggplant),
      potato, tomato, etc. Sattu is one of the significant ingredients in Bihari
      as well as some other North Indian cuisines. Basically, sattu as an
      individual ingredient, has a lot of health benefits too. One of the
      noteworthy ones being its cooling properties. Thus, it is a preferred
      choice of ingredient in areas with extreme weather conditions during
      summers. Litti Chokha together forms a really brilliant combo consisting
      of varied flavors and textures. An original recipe for any chokha will
      have the main vegetable (brinjal, potato or tomato) being roasted or
      boiled, then skinned off (if needed). Later mashed with other ingredients
      like onion, garlic, green chilies, coriander leaves, salt, lemon juice and
      a generous quantity of mustard oil.
