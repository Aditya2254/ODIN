    <h3>Poha Recipe</h3>
    <p>
      Poha is one of India’s most popular breakfast (especially in North and
      western India). Flattened rice is tempered with spices and onions making
      it the perfect way to start the day. Growing up, I wasn’t a huge Poha fan.
      I was okay with it but I would never ask mom to make it. But of course it
      was made very often in my house. And the reason for that is that it’s a
      filling and nutritious breakfast which gets done in no time!

    <h4>What is Poha</h4>
    <p>
      Poha (flattened rice) is typically a Western Indian breakfast recipe but
      it’s taste and ease of making has made it extremely popular all over
      India. Poha is very easy to make, it requires almost no cooking, the
      flattened rice just need to be rinsed till it’s softened and that’s about
      it. You don’t need to cook it like any other grain. Traditionally in the
      state of Maharasthra, it is known as “kanda poha” (kanda=onion) where poha
      is made with only onions and I prefer that version too. I know a lot of
      people add lot of veggies to their poha which you can definitely do but I
      like it simple with only onions at green peas. When I first started making
      poha, it never turned out good. In fact, I would always ask Sarvesh to
      make it since he made it so much better. Mine would always turn out mushy
      or too dry. But then over the years, as I started making poha frequently
      for breakfast, I learned the little things which help in making the
      perfect poha!
